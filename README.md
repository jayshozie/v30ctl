# v30ctl

`v30ctl` is a configuration tool for the gaming mouse `Motospeed V30`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] **RGB Control:** This may be achieved via
`OpenRGB`. I did not test it, yet. This to-do may be removed if it works OOTB.
This specific model has a few presets in its official Windows driver. I will try
to port them, too. 

- [ ] **Button Configuration:** This specific model has 3 configurable buttons.
1. 2 buttons on the side, that is mostly used for web-surfing (backwards/forwards in a web page).
2. 1 button on the top, that is mostly used for DPI control.
